# ttrpgCompanion

This project will eventually become a companion app to allow players to quickly and easily create characters for their favorite tabletop games, as well as being able to being able to save/export their character. Initially it will be created with just the scope of Dnd 5e, but will evetually branch out to other popular ttrpgs. I'm still a beginner when it comes to programming so if you happen upon this project, bare with me as I improve and scale this project over time!

Future goals:
- Create a complete character/npc sheet quickly
- Fully flesh out dice functionality
- Export character to an external file or possible a PDF
- Add functionality for more ttrpgs
- and more
